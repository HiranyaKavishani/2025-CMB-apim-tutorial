# Design an Enterprise API Management Architecture

This session provides a deep dive into modern enterprise API management architectures—elevated with AI-driven capabilities. You'll learn how to design scalable, secure, and intelligent API ecosystems using WSO2 API Manager, Bijira (AI-native SaaS), Moesif, Auth0, and MCP Servers.

---

## Objectives

- Understand core API management concepts and architectural patterns
- Explore advanced API design and governance strategies powered by AI
- Gain hands-on experience through guided live demos and labs

---

## What You'll Discover

- The role and power of API Gateways and Developer Portals
- Enforcing robust security, policy management, and rate limiting
- Implementing analytics and observability using tools like Moesif
- Key enterprise concerns:
    - Multi-tenancy
    - High Availability
    - CI/CD integrations
- Evolving your architecture with:
    - WSO2 API Manager
    - Bijira (AI-Native API SaaS)
    - MCP Servers as Secure Ingress
    - AI Gateways for Intelligent API Consumption

---

## Hands-On Use Cases

### [Use Case 01 – API Design and Invocation](#)
- Define a sample product API using OpenAPI specs
- Apply best practices: security, versioning, rate limits
- Deploy and test via WSO2 API Gateway
- Invoke API securely using OAuth2 tokens

### [Use Case 02 – Integrating Moesif & Auth0](#)
- Configure Auth0 as external Key Manager
- Add Moesif for full-stack API analytics
- Capture API consumption metrics, detect anomalies, and analyze trends

### [Use Case 03 – Consume APIs Intelligently via MCP]()
- Use MCP Servers to intelligently route API calls
- Subscribe to APIs through Developer Portal
- Apply AI-enhanced routing and monitoring patterns
